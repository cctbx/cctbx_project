# PHENIX AI Agent - Workflow Definitions
# =============================================================================
# This file defines the workflow (state machine) for each experiment type.
#
# Each workflow has:
#   - phases: Sequential stages of structure determination
#   - transitions: Rules for moving between phases
#   - targets: Quality metrics that define "done"
#
# To modify workflow behavior, edit the phases and transitions.
# To change quality thresholds, edit the targets section.
