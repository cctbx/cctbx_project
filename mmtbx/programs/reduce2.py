The third is the chain ID. The fourth is the residue name. The fifth is the residue id, which may include an insertion code as its last character. The sixth is either Flipped or Unflipped. If it is Flipped, then another word is added -- AnglesAdjusted or AnglesNotAdjusted, specifying whether to do the three-point dock to adjust the bond angles after the flip.

class Program(ProgramTemplate):
  description = '''
reduce2 version {}
Add Hydrogens to a model and optimize their placement by adjusting movable groups and
flippable groups of atoms.

Inputs:
  PDB or mmCIF file containing atomic model
  Ligand CIF file, if needed
Output:
  PDB or mmCIF file with added hydrogens.  If output.filename is specified, then the
  type of file to write will be determined by its suffix (.pdb or .cif).
  If output.filename is not specified, the output file will be
  written into the current working directory with the same base name and type as the
  original file and with FH or H added to the base name (FH when flips are requested);
  1xs0.pdb would be written to ./1xsoH.pdb and 1xso.cif to ./1xsoH.cif by default.

NOTES:
  If multiple alternates are present in the file and a specific one is not specified on the
  command line, they will all be processed in reverse order, such that the lowest-named
  one (perhaps A) will be processed last.  The hydrogen addition and arrangements for
  residues that are not part of any alternate will be left in the configuration that is best
  for the final alternate tested.  This may leave other alternates in sub-optimal configurations.
  When a single alternate is selected using alt_id= on the command line, everything is
  optimized a single time and for that configuration.

  Note that the program also takes probe Phil arguments; run with --show_defaults to see
  all Phil arguments.

  As of 7/14/2025, reduce2 is switching to new default parameters for the relative weighting of
  external contacts (which remains the same) and both hydrogen bonds and collisions (whic are
  increasing by 10x). This is to work as expected with a radius larger than 0 (it is being switched
  to 0.25, which matches the probe2 default). The original Reduce had switched to a radius of 0.0
  and was not considering external contacts; this fixes that without causing hydrogen bonds to be
  broken. See https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/issues/1072 for details. The defaults for
  probe2 are not being changed, so its default behavior will be different from reduce2 until the
  issue can be fully resolved and both set to the same defaults. The probe radius and relative
  weights can be set in both probe2 and reduce2 using the probe2 Phil parameters if different
  behavior is desired.

  Equivalent PHIL arguments for original Reduce command-line options:
    -quiet: No equivalent; metadata is never written to the model file, it is always
            written to the description file, and progress information is always written
            to standard output.
