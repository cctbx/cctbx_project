Client / Server architecture for spot counting at beamlines.

Server:

libtbx.python mp_spotfinder_server_read_file.py <port number> <number of processes> [<outer resolution limit in Angstroms>]

Client

libtbx.python thin_client.py <filepath> <host> <port>

Caveats(6/2/2010):
  -- although the server is supposed to queue requests, too many at once can 
     cause some requests to drop out.  Behavior isn't fully characterized.  
     Therefore in the example given (thin_client.csh), a /bin/sleep command
     is used to time the requests at a reasonable pace given the particular
     server host and number of processes.
